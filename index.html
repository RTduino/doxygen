RTduino Header Files Explained</h2>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md7"></a>
Arduino.h</h3>
<p>This header file acts as the cornerstone for RTduino applications, encapsulating the essence of the Arduino development environment within the RTduino framework. It defines the fundamental data types, constants, and function prototypes crucial for Arduino compatibility. By including <code><a class="el" href="Arduino_8h.html" title="Arduino Core Header File.">Arduino.h</a></code>, developers ensure their code adheres to the familiar Arduino API. This facilitation allows for a seamless transition of Arduino projects to the RTduino platform and enables the use of a vast array of existing Arduino libraries and sketches with minimal modifications.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md8"></a>
RTduino.h</h3>
<p>While <code><a class="el" href="Arduino_8h.html" title="Arduino Core Header File.">Arduino.h</a></code> focuses on Arduino compatibility, <code><a class="el" href="RTduino_8h.html" title="RTduino Core Header File.">RTduino.h</a></code> serves as the bridge to the advanced features and real-time capabilities provided by the RT-Thread operating system.
